Exercise 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook
Create a new Jupyter notebook called DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb

Exercise 2: Create markdown cell with title of the notebook
Create a markdown cell with the title Data Science Tools and Ecosystem using the H1 style heading.

Exercise 3: Create a markdown cell for an introduction
Write an introductory sentence about the notebook, such as the following:
In this notebook, data science tools and ecosystems are summarized.

Exercise 4: Create a markdown cell to list data science languages
Start the cell with an overview line, such as:
Some of the popular languages that data scientists use are:
Then create an ordered list (i.e., numbered) listing three (or more) commonly used languages for data science.

Exercise 5: Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries
Add an overview line to the cell, like:
Some of the commonly used libraries used by data scientists include:
Below this line, add an ordered list listing three (or more) commonly used libraries in data science.

Exercise 6: Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools
Create a single-column table in this cell with the first row containing the header Data Science Tools. The subsequent three rows in the table should indicate three development environments for open-source tools used in data science.

Exercise 7: Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples
Add a line in this cell with an H3-style heading and text like:
Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

Exercise 8: Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers
In this code cell, evaluate the expression (3*4)+5.
Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation, e.g.  This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply, then add integers.
Then execute the cell to ensure the expression returns the expected output of 17.

Exercise 9: Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours
In this code cell, write an expression that converts 200 minutes into hours.
Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation, e.g.  This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing 60.
Run the cell to evaluate the expression.

Exercise 10: Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives
Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e., some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell, start with an introductory line titled Objectives: in bold font. Then, using an unordered list (bullets), indicate 3â€“5 items covered in this notebook, such as the list of popular languages for data science.

Exercise 11: Create a markdown cell to indicate the Author's name
In this markdown cell, include the following text: Author in the H2 style heading. Include your name as regular text below the word author.
